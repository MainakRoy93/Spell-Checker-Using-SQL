# Spell-Checker-Using-SQL
The sql code uses fuzzy logic mathching to find similar words aimed at finding spelling errors. The implementation is based on q-gram logic, which is explained as below.

Given a string σ, itspositional q-grams are obtained by “sliding” a window of length q over the characters of σ. Since q-grams at the beginning and the end of the string can have fewer than q characters from σ, we introduce new characters “#” and “%”not in Σ, and conceptually extend the string σ by prefixing it with q−1 occurrences of “#” and suffixing it with q−1 occurrences of “%”.Thus, each q-gram contains exactly q characters, though some of these may not be from the alphabet Σ.

Definition :A positional q-gram of a string σ is a pair(i, σ[i . . . i+q−1]), where σ[i . . . i+q−1] is the q-gram of σ that starts at position i, counting on the extended string.  The set Gσ of all positional q-grams of a string σ is the set of all the|σ|+q−1 pairs constructed from all q-grams of σ. The intuition behind the use of q-grams as a foundation for approximate string processing is that when two strings σ1 and σ2 are within a small edit distance of each other, they share a large number of q-grams in common [6, 4]. Consider the following example.  The positional q-grams of lengthq=3 for string johnsmith are{(1,##j),(2,#jo),(3,joh),(4,ohn),(5,hn),(6,ns),(7,sm),(8,smi),(9,mit),(10,ith),(11,th%),(12,h%%)}.  Similarly, the positional q-grams of lengthq=3 for johnasmith, which is at an edit distance of two from johnsmith,  are{(1,##j),(2,#jo),(3,joh),(4,ohn),(5,hn),(6,na),(7,a),(8,as),(9,sm),(10,smi),(11,mit),(12,ith),(13,th%),(14,h%%)}. If we ignore the position information,  the two q-gram sets have 11 q-grams in common.   In-terestingly,  only the first five positional q-grams of the first string are also positional q-grams of the secondstring. However, an additional six positional q-grams in the two strings differ in their position by just two posi-tions each. This illustrates that, in general, the use of positional q-grams for approximate string processing will involve comparing positions of “matching” q-grams within a certain “band.”
